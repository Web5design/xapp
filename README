This is the XOXCO Boilerplate for making mobile sites.

It takes (mostly) semantic markup and turns it into 
something that looks as close as possible to a "native"
app.

Should work as a baseline for apps served in the traditional
way - ie, served on demand - or as an offline app -
ie, phonegap or otherwise archived on the phone.
